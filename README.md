Overview of the project:
This project introduces foundational concepts of embedded programming and hardware interfacing by programming an Arduino to blink an LED at a specific interval.

Objectives:
Understand how to set up and program an Arduino board.
Learn basic embedded programming concepts such as pin modes, digital I/O, and delays.
Explore hardware interfacing by connecting an LED and a resistor to the Arduino.
Demonstrate control over physical components using software.
Develop debugging skills for simple circuits and code.

Key Activities

Component Setup and Connections:
Set up the circuit by connecting an LED and a resistor to the Arduino.
Identify and use the appropriate pins (digital output and ground) on the Arduino board.

Programming the Arduino:
Write a program to blink the LED at a defined interval.
Understand and implement basic functions like pinMode() and digitalWrite().

Testing and Debugging:
Test the setup to ensure the LED blinks at the correct interval.
Debug any issues in the circuit (e.g., incorrect wiring) or code (e.g., syntax errors).

Technologies Used

Hardware:
Arduino Uno (or similar): A microcontroller board used to execute the program.
LED (Light Emitting Diode): A component that emits light when powered.
Resistor (220Ω or 330Ω): Limits current to prevent damage to the LED.
Software:Arduino IDE

Key Insights

Programming Basics:
Learn how to configure pins as input or output and control them programmatically.
Understand the flow of a simple embedded system program with setup() and loop() functions.

Hardware Interfacing:
Grasp the concept of electrical components like LEDs and resistors and their role in circuits.
Understand the importance of current-limiting resistors to protect components.

Timing and Control:
Use the delay() function to control timing in embedded systems.
Recognize the limitations of blocking delays (e.g., delay() stops other processes) and explore alternatives like non-blocking delays later.

Debugging and Problem Solving:
Develop debugging techniques for identifying issues in circuits (e.g., incorrect polarity of LED) or code (e.g., wrong pin configuration).
